# Smart Task Logger Enhancements - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines comprehensive enhancements to transform the existing Juey task logger into a truly intelligent, AI-powered productivity assistant. The focus is on implementing smart suggestion algorithms, voice input capabilities, enhanced context capture, robust offline functionality, and adaptive reminder systems to create a seamless task logging experience that learns from user behavior and provides proactive assistance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AI-Powered Suggestion Engine

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to intelligently suggest tasks based on my historical patterns, current context, and productivity trends, so that I can stay on top of important activities without having to remember everything myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the suggestions screen THEN the system SHALL display personalized task suggestions based on my historical data
2. WHEN I complete tasks regularly at specific times THEN the system SHALL detect these patterns and suggest similar tasks at optimal times
3. WHEN I provide feedback on suggestions THEN the system SHALL learn from this feedback and improve future recommendations
4. WHEN I have recurring task patterns THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest the next occurrence with appropriate timing
5. WHEN my productivity patterns change THEN the system SHALL adapt suggestions to match new behaviors within 7 days
6. WHEN I'm in a specific location or time context THEN the system SHALL prioritize contextually relevant suggestions
7. WHEN I haven't logged tasks for a category in a while THEN the system SHALL suggest tasks from neglected areas
8. WHEN I have high-priority incomplete tasks THEN the system SHALL surface these with increased urgency

### Requirement 2: Voice Input and Natural Language Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to quickly log tasks using voice commands and natural language, so that I can capture tasks hands-free and with minimal friction while maintaining context and detail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press the voice input button THEN the system SHALL start recording my voice and provide visual feedback
2. WHEN I speak a task description THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text with 95%+ accuracy for clear speech
3. WHEN I use natural language like "remind me to call John tomorrow at 3pm" THEN the system SHALL parse and extract task title, due date, and reminder time
4. WHEN I mention categories like "work meeting" or "grocery shopping" THEN the system SHALL automatically categorize the task appropriately
5. WHEN I specify priority keywords like "urgent" or "important" THEN the system SHALL set the appropriate priority level
6. WHEN I say "I just finished..." THEN the system SHALL create a completed task with the current timestamp
7. WHEN voice recognition fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback text input with the partial transcription
8. WHEN I'm in a noisy environment THEN the system SHALL use noise cancellation and provide confidence indicators

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Context Capture

**User Story:** As a user, I want to enrich my tasks with contextual information like images, location, and environmental data, so that I have better context for completing tasks and can track patterns more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a task THEN the system SHALL offer to capture current location if location services are enabled
2. WHEN I attach an image to a task THEN the system SHALL compress and store it locally and sync to cloud storage
3. WHEN I take a photo for a task THEN the system SHALL use OCR to extract text and suggest it as task description
4. WHEN I'm at a frequently visited location THEN the system SHALL suggest location-specific tasks
5. WHEN I create tasks at specific times of day THEN the system SHALL learn my time-based patterns
6. WHEN I log tasks with weather context THEN the system SHALL track correlations between weather and task types
7. WHEN I complete location-based tasks THEN the system SHALL learn optimal locations for different task categories
8. WHEN I attach multiple images THEN the system SHALL create a gallery view for the task

### Requirement 4: Robust Offline Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work seamlessly offline and handle sync conflicts intelligently, so that I never lose data and can use the app regardless of connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm offline THEN the system SHALL queue all operations and provide immediate local feedback
2. WHEN I come back online THEN the system SHALL automatically sync queued operations in chronological order
3. WHEN there are sync conflicts THEN the system SHALL present conflict resolution options with clear differences
4. WHEN I modify the same task offline and online THEN the system SHALL merge changes intelligently or prompt for resolution
5. WHEN sync fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL provide manual sync options and error details
6. WHEN I'm offline for extended periods THEN the system SHALL continue providing AI suggestions based on local data
7. WHEN network is intermittent THEN the system SHALL handle partial syncs gracefully without data corruption
8. WHEN I delete tasks offline THEN the system SHALL handle tombstone records to prevent resurrection on sync

### Requirement 5: Smart Adaptive Reminders

**User Story:** As a user, I want intelligent reminders that learn when I'm most likely to complete tasks and adapt to my schedule and context, so that I receive timely notifications that actually help rather than annoy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I consistently complete tasks at certain times THEN the system SHALL learn my optimal reminder timing
2. WHEN I snooze or dismiss reminders frequently THEN the system SHALL adjust reminder frequency and timing
3. WHEN I'm in a meeting or busy period THEN the system SHALL delay non-urgent reminders until I'm available
4. WHEN I complete similar tasks at specific locations THEN the system SHALL send location-based reminders
5. WHEN I have a pattern of task completion THEN the system SHALL predict the best reminder time with 80%+ accuracy
6. WHEN I respond positively to reminders THEN the system SHALL reinforce similar timing patterns
7. WHEN my schedule changes significantly THEN the system SHALL adapt reminder patterns within 3-5 days
8. WHEN I set custom reminder preferences THEN the system SHALL respect these while still learning patterns

### Requirement 6: Advanced Pattern Recognition

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to recognize complex patterns in my task completion behavior, so that it can provide insights and suggestions that help me optimize my productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log tasks over time THEN the system SHALL identify recurring task sequences and suggest the next logical task
2. WHEN I have productivity cycles THEN the system SHALL recognize high and low energy periods and suggest appropriate tasks
